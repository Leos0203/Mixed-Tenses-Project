          The code here is very simple. If you click the Log In button the Log
          In Form opens, same thing for the Registration Form.

          class="form-img"
        />
        <p class="form-text">
          The code here does two things. First, if you click the Register button
          the Registration Form appears. If you click log in a few checks have
          to be completed for the Log In to be successful. First, we check if a
          file exists, if it doesn't then a registration doesn't exist and has
          to be made first. If it does then we open the file "login.txt" and get
          the credentials. If they are the same as the ones entered in the
          fields then a message will appear and when you click ok the
          Information Form appears.

        />
        <p class="form-text">
          The code here makes the registration. When you write valid username
          and passwords the code uses System.IO to write into a file and save
          them for later use.

        <p class="form-text">
          In this form we first make all buttons, lists and labels invisible
          until the right option is chosen. When "Mixed Tenses in Storytelling"
          is selected everything appears and you can read about the tense. There
          are 4 separate list boxes which are switched when next is clicked.
          When one is shown the others are hidden. The sample story and test
          buttons open the coresponding forms.

          The test consists of 4 group boxes and all of them except the first
          one are hidden on launch. The test is made of 4 radio buttons with 4
          answers only one correct. When the button check is clicked an
          explanation is shown in label2, the correct answer's radio button's
          back color is set to lime and a point is given if the answer is
          correct. The points are also displayed at the top. If the next or
          previous buttons are clicked the question is changed to the next or
          previous one and the explanation label, radio buttons' back colors are
          cleared and the new group box is shown.
